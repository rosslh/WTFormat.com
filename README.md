Formatting dates is a common task in web development. Date formatting libraries usually require two inputs: a **date** and a **format code**. Figuring out the correct format code for a desired date format can be challenging and time-consuming. For example, achieving the date format `Sat, Jun 24` in Moment.js requires the format code `ddd, MMM D`.

[WTFormat.com](https://wtformat.com/) simplifies this process. This user-friendly tool gives you a date which you then rewrite in your desired format. When you click "generate", WTFormat outputs the corresponding format code for various popular date libraries, including [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/), and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/). This eliminates the need to memorize or search for format codes, saving you time and effort.
